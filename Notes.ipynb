    "### 4.1 Training\n",
    "\n",
    "`Delta+delta-delta`: training computes delta and double-delta features, or dynamic coefficients, to supplement the MFCC features. Delta and delta-delta features are numerical estimates of the first and second order derivatives of the signal (features). As such, the computation is usually performed on a larger window of feature vectors. While a window of two feature vectors would probably work, it would be a very crude approximation (similar to how a delta-difference is a very crude approximation of the derivative). Delta features are computed on the window of the original features; the delta-delta are then computed on the window of the delta-features.\n",
    "\n",
    "`LDA-MLLT`: stands for Linear Discriminant Analysis â€“ Maximum Likelihood Linear Transform. The Linear Discriminant Analysis takes the feature vectors and builds HMM states, but with a reduced feature space for all data. The Maximum Likelihood Linear Transform takes the reduced feature space from the LDA and derives a unique transformation for each speaker. MLLT is therefore a step towards speaker normalization, as it minimizes differences among speakers.\n",
    "\n",
    "`LDA`: In natural language processing, latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a generative statistical model that allows sets of observations to be explained by unobserved groups that explain why some parts of the data are similar. For example, if observations are words collected into documents, it posits that each document is a mixture of a small number of topics and that each word's presence is attributable to one of the document's topics. LDA is an example of a topic model.\n",
    "\n",
    "`SAT`: stands for Speaker Adaptive Training. SAT also performs speaker and noise normalization by adapting to each specific speaker with a particular data transform. This results in more homogenous or standardized data, allowing the model to use its parameters on estimating variance due to the phoneme, as opposed to the speaker or recording environment.\n",

This is also known as Viterbi training (related, but more computationally expensive procedures include the Forward-Backward algorithm and Expectation Maximization). By aligning the audio to the reference transcript with the most current acoustic model, additional training algorithms can then use this output to improve or refine the parameters of the model. Therefore, each training step will be followed by an alignment step where the audio and text can be realigned.\n",
